# SECJ1013-Programming-Technique-1
**Lecturer: Dr Jamilah binti Mahmood**

Reflection on course

The Programming Technique 1 course has provided a strong foundation in writing efficient and effective code.The process of debugging and error handling was also studied. At the same time,through practical assignments and projects, problem-solving abilities were strengthened.
The skills gained in this course are expected to be useful in future programming tasks. 

# LABS

Reflection

Answering the lab test question provide a deeper understanding of the programming concepts and strengthen the theoretical knowledge learned in the lectural. The lab exercises also help me develop better problem-solving skills by understanding the core concepts that influence the way to write a correct functional code.

Reflection

Completing the assignments provide chances to implement theoretical programming concepts into real functional programs. Writing code has helped to refine the problem-solving skills. Logical and critical thinking mindset also developed during process of breaking complex problems into smaller, solvable parts.
